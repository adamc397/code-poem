Code Poem
This is my code poem. It's inspired by a piece of poetry I wrote about a funeral I once went to. I wanted to imagine the perspective of a parent at a funeral, that headspace, what the thought process would be like walking into that, and how hard that must be. It's difficult to make a figma for that, so I just tried to be relatively consistent emotionally. The image is a drawing done by my friend who's since passed. He was the origin of the idea, among a million other wonderful things.
